This repository contains 1 R script used to process the raw spacer frequency data included in dataset S2 (excel file included as supplementary material). As outlined in Figure S1, this script was utilized to normalize the total spacer counts between paired untreated/Sal4-treated samples, filter out spacers with less than 100 total reads, determine the ratio of each spacer between treatment (Sal4-treated/untreated) conditions, list spacers with ratio ≥ 2.0 (enriched) or ≤ 0.5 (de-enriched), calculate the log2 fold change and standard deviation for both lists, intersect both lists across all four replicates, align the resulting enriched and de-enriched lists with the spacer assignment and STm 14028s genome information (Dataset S1 and S3, respectively), isolate genes with more than one associated spacer, and finally export selected data frames into an Excel (.xlsx) file (Dataset S4).
